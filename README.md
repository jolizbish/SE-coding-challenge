## Story
As the SkillsEngine engineering team we want see how you code a rails app that takes advantage of our ML and NLP APIs to analyze job descriptions for skills and uses React on the frontend to display the results in the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Application is built using rails 5 and the `react-on-rails` [gem](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails) to render React components in a rails view
* Application is deployed to Heroku and is publicly accessible.
* Application sends the user-inputted job description to SkillsEngine's Profiler API for analysis.
* Application logs the results of any call to the SkillsEngine APIs
* Application displays 'detailed work activities' to the user as suggested skills.
* Application uses React to build/update/display all UI elements.
* UI is styled to match the mockup in this repo
* Users **are not** required to login
* Users are able to type or copy/paste text into the 'Job Description' field and get a list of suggested skills as they type.
* Users are able to add suggested skills to the selected skills list by clicking the plus (+) icon.
* Users are able to remove selected skills from the list by clicking the remove (x) icon.

## Submission Tips
* Quality is better than speed. We'd rather you take a little more time to do things well then submit poor quality work.
* Ensure that your submission accurately reflects your coding style.
* Comment. Comment. Comment. The more we can understand your thought process, the better.
* Tests are not required but highly encouraged.
* Make sure to review the [API documentation](https://dev.skillsengine.com/docs/v2competenciesanalyzeflatten) when integrating your app with the SkillsEngine API.
* **DO NOT COPY OTHER DEVELOPER'S CODE.** We want to see your code not our own or something from stack overflow.

## Submitting your project
